# /create - DEPRECATED

> ⚠️ **This command is deprecated.**
>
> Use `/fullstack-idea` for full pipeline or `/fullstack-idea --quick` for fast creation.

## Migration Guide

| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/create blog site` | `/fullstack-idea "blog site"` |
| `/create todo app` | `/fullstack-idea --quick "todo app"` |

## Why Deprecated?

`/create` functionality is now fully covered by `/fullstack-idea`:

- Multi-agent orchestration (better quality)
- Skill loading (better context)
- Checkpoints (better control)
- QA gates (better verification)
